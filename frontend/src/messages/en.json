  "FAQ": {
    "Heading": "The Most Asked Questions",
    "Question": "What does an airport transfer do?",
    "Answer": "An airport transfer is a private car service which takes air passengers to and from the airport from a city or transport hub. Professional airport transfer services like Blacklane offer chauffeur-driven vehicles to pick up passengers in the terminal after they collect their luggage, or drop them off to their departure gate well ahead of time. As a global company Blacklane is ideally suited to airport transfers, as they can handle passenger’s needs at both ends of their international flight."
